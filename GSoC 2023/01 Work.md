•	Discussed the projects work plan and the actual deliverables. 
•	Discussed about different solutions for the microcontroller. Another candidate than the Node MCU was the Datalogger IoT – 9DoF which is an ESP8266-based data logger from Sparkfun, but it is not suitable. 
•	Decided to start working in the pendulum experiment first, establish connection with the ESP8266 and 
•	Discussed for some changes in sensor selection for the first experiment.
