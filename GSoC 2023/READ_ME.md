**The description of all the sensors and actuators used for each experiment can be found in the `Google Summer of Code 2023 Final Evaluation` Zip file. In the same file there are step by step instruction for how to set up the devices and dashboards at the ThingsBoard server. In the `nodemcu-box-model_files.zip` file there are also some 3D printable CAD files that anyone can download and print a box for their ESP8266.**

*NOTE: The interface of thingsboard comunity edition may change after this work is complete. This project was completed in October 2023*

**Below you can also find the PINOUT diagram of the NodeMCU ESP8266 board and a table that contains information on which pins could create problems while booting up the microcontroller.**
