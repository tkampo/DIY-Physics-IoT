### **The description of all the sensors and actuators used for each experiment can be found in the `Google Summer of Code 2023 Final Evaluation` Zip file. In the same file there are step by step instruction for how to set up the devices and dashboards at the ThingsBoard server. In the `nodemcu-box-model_files.zip` file there are also some 3D printable CAD files that anyone can download and print a box for their ESP8266. There is one really helpful photo that contains the PINOUT diagram of the NodeMCU ESP8266 board and another photo that contains information on which pins could create problems while booting up the microcontroller.** 

**NOTE: The interface of thingsboard comunity edition may change after this work is complete. This project was completed in October 2023**
